Most people start with a CHIP-8 emulator. As with any system, see <#482208284032499713> to get started.
*Note*: A great guide that still keeps it challenging is <https://tobiasvl.github.io/blog/write-a-chip-8-emulator/>.

After that, you can pretty much move to whatever system you want to. You don't _have_ to "work your way up" to it as many seem to think (relevant opinionated thread here: <https://goo.gl/CAvrd4>).
Just make sure you have the basics down first, study the source code of existing emulators (super important) and if you get stuck, ask questions here or in the subreddit.
If you contribute to a project that has its own community/resources, you should probably prioritize that.

## Reverse Engineering
In emulation, RE-ing is often needed for system BIOSes, operating systems, drivers, OS modules and games to aid in understanding of what the hardware does & emulate it properly when the documentation is insufficient or incomplete (ie. always).
It's a huge area of expertise & there is no be-all end-all resource, but a decent starting point might be <https://beginners.re> (older but free mirror: <https://mirrors.ocf.berkeley.edu/parrot/misc/openbooks/programming/ReverseEngineeringForBeginners.en.pdf>)
- These videos from LiveOverflow & stacksmashing are a fun introduction to some fundamental concepts: <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLniOzp3l9V82onKsktyyKlIenAAUj45Mk>
- There are _way_ too many resources about this. It's a skill used in many disciplines. Look around, find what you like (otherwise you might not be motivated for long).

### Static analysis
The industry standard tools are:
- **[Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org)**: There are loaders/extensions for pretty much all consoles/processors, search for them.
- **[IDA Pro](https://www.hex-rays.com/ida-pro)**: Proprietary, paid, closed-source. Industry-standard for professionals - especially before Ghidra it was the only viable option. I don't personally recommend it, especially for architectures other than x86. Also if you want to get it legally, it costs multiple thousands of dollars vs. Ghidra being free & open source.

### Dynamic analysis / Debugging
The standard tool that's cross-platform and supports many architectures is **gdb**.
- Many emulators implement "gdbstub"s that allow them to use a gdb client to debug guest code just like you would debug something running on the host. Meaning, you would be able to place breakpoints, step, etc via any gdb interface (ie. gdbgui), on GameBoy code or whatever you're emulating.
  - IDA Pro has debugging support that works with gdbstubs.
  - <https://hugsy.github.io/gef/>
  - <https://www.gdbgui.com>
- Other projects choose to make their own integrated debuggers with (ie. <https://github.com/ocornut/imgui>). This is perhaps more work, but more flexible (and many people don't like gdb).
  - For x86, the industry standard tool is <https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg>.
